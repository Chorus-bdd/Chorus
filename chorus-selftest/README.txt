CHORUS-SELFTEST:
****************

chorus-selftest is a module containing component tests intended to provide good coverage for Chorus

See more notes in the main chorus interpreter README.txt about the output of Chorus

Here, we're testing Chorus' output across all use cases -
i.e what should happen when a test run with Chorus run successfully, but also what happens if a test fails etc.
