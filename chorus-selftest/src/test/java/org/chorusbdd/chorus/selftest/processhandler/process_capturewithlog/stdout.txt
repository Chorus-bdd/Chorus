    Given I start a capturewithlog process                                                   PASSED  
    When I read the line 'and another longer line' from the capturewithlog process           PASSED  
    And I read the line 'an error has occurred' from the capturewithlog process std error    PASSED  
    Then the std out log contains the string let's match a line                              PASSED  
    Then the std out log contains the string and another longer line                         PASSED  
    And the std err log contains the string an error has occurred                            PASSED
