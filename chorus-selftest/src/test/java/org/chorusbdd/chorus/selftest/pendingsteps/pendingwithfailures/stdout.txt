Feature: Pending Steps With Failures                                                                 
Chorus --> INFO    - Running feature from file: src/test/java/org/chorusbdd/chorus/selftest/pendingsteps/pendingwithfailures/pendingstepswithfailedscenario.feature
  Scenario: Pending Annotations
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Pending Annotations
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a feature with three scenario                                             PASSED  
    And a pending step gets a pending status                                                 PENDING bonjour, mes amis, I am a pending step
    While subsequent steps are skipped                                                       SKIPPED

    Then if I call a missing step not marked pending the scenario and feature will fail      UNDEFINED
