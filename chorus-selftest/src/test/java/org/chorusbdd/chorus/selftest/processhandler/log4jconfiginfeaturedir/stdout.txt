    When I start a config1 process                                                           PASSED  
    And I wait for config1 to stop                                                           PASSED  
    Then log4j has written to the log4jlogs/log4jconfiginfeaturedir-config1.log file         PASSED  
    And I can delete the log file log4jlogs/log4jconfiginfeaturedir-config1.log              PASSED
