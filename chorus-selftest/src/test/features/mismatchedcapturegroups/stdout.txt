  Scenario: Mismatched Capture Groups Params One
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    And I pass a parameter 10 matched by a regex with one capture group but no method params UNDEFINED 
    Then the subsequent steps fail                                                           SKIPPED

    And I pass a parameter 10 matched by a regex with 2 capture groups but just one param    UNDEFINED 
    Then the subsequent steps fail                                                           SKIPPED
