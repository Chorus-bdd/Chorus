    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    And the context has no values in it                                                      PASSED  
    And I create a variable varone with value 1.2                                            PASSED  
    And I create a context variable vartwo with value wibble                                 PASSED  
    Then variable varone exists                                                              PASSED

    And variable varone has the value 1.2                                                    PASSED

    And I show variable varone                                                               PASSED  varone=1.2
