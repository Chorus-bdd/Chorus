Feature: Multiple Scenario                                                                           
  Scenario: Simple Scenario One
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a step in scenario one                                                    PASSED  
    And if a step fails                                                                      FAILED  This step threw an exception to fail it
    Then the subsequent steps are skipped                                                    SKIPPED 
    But the next scenario still runs                                                         SKIPPED 
  Scenario: Simple Scenario Two
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a step in scenario two                                                    PASSED  
    And if a step is not implemented                                                         UNDEFINED 
    Then the subsequent steps are skipped                                                    SKIPPED 
    But the next scenario still runs                                                         SKIPPED 
  Scenario: Simple Scenario Three
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a step in scenario three                                                  PASSED  
  Scenario: Simple Scenario Four
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a step in scenario four                                                   PASSED
