Feature: Undefined Step                                                                              
  Scenario: Simple Scenario
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a feature with a single scenario                                          PASSED  
    And if a step is undefined                                                               UNDEFINED 
    Then the subsequent step is skipped                                                      SKIPPED
