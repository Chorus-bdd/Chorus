    Given I start a config1 process named DualHandlerExport                                  PASSED  
    Then I can call a step method exported by the handler in DualHandlerExport               PASSED  
    And I can stop process DualHandlerExport                                                 PASSED

    Given I start a config1 process named DualHandlerExport                                  PASSED

    And I call a step method exported by handler two in DualHandlerExport                    PASSED  two
    And I call a step method exported by both handlers in DualHandlerExport                  FAILED  (StepMatcher:linenumber)-DuplicateStepMatchException Ambiguous step [I call a step method exported by both handlers], more than one implementation (RemoteComponent:DualHandlerExport:JmxDualHandlerExportHandler:canCallAStepMethodExportedByBoth / RemoteComponent:DualHandlerExport:JmxDualHandlerExportHandlerTwo:canCallAStepMethodExportedByBoth)
    Then a ChorusException is thrown with a message which reports the ambiguity              SKIPPED
