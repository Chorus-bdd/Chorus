    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can call a global macro with three variables lemon 123 and aardvark               >>      
    .. Then I can call the macro from any feature file since macros are preparsed               PASSED  
    .. And variables are all expanded within the macro steps for example lemon 123 aardvark     PASSED  lemon.123.aardvark
