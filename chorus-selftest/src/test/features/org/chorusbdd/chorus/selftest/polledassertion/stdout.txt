  Scenario: Passes Within Invoker Is Working
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Passes Within Invoker Is Working
    Given I increment a value with a timer task                                              PASSED  
    And the value is 1 within default period                                                 PASSED  
    When I increment a value with a timer task                                               PASSED  
    Then the value is 2 within 2 seconds                                                     PASSED  
    When I increment a value with a timer task                                               PASSED  
    Then the value is not 3 within 0.2 seconds so this step should fail                      FAILED  (PolledAssertionHandler:linenumber)-Expect 3 expected:<3> but was:<2>
