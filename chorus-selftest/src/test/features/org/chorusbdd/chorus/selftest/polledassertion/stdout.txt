    Given I increment a value with a timer task                                              PASSED

    Then the value is 2 within 2 seconds                                                     PASSED  
    When I increment a value with a timer task                                               PASSED  
    Then the value is not 3 within 0.2 seconds so this step should fail                      FAILED  (PolledAssertionHandler:linenumber)-Expect 3 expected:<3> but was:<2>
