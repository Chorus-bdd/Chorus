    Then I can run a feature with a single scenario                                          PASSED  
    And a pending step gets a pending status                                                 PENDING bonjour, mes amis, I am a pending step
    While subsequent steps are skipped                                                       SKIPPED 
  Scenario: Pending Exceptions Are Handled

    If I throw a PendingException then that step is shown pending with the exception message PENDING Hola?
    And subsequent steps are skipped                                                         SKIPPED
