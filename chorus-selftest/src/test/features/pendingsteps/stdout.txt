    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a feature with a single scenario                                          PASSED  
    And a pending step gets a pending status                                                 PENDING bonjour, mes amis, I am a pending step
    While subsequent steps are skipped                                                       SKIPPED
