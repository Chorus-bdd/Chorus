  Scenario: Call An Exported Method
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Call An Exported Method
Chorus --> INFO    - About to run Java:  <system specific process details replaced>
    Given I start a config1 process named DualHandlerExport                                  PASSED  
Exporting the handler
    And I wait for 1 second for the process to start up                                      PASSED  
    Then I can call a step method exported by the handler in DualHandlerExport               PASSED  
  Scenario: Call A Conflicting Method

    And I wait for 1 second for the process to start up                                      PASSED  
    And I call a step method exported by handler one in DualHandlerExport                    PASSED  One
    And I call a step method exported by handler two in DualHandlerExport                    PASSED  two
Chorus --> INFO    - Ambiguous method (JmxDualHandlerExportHandler.canCallAStepMethodExportedByBoth) found for step (I call a step method exported by both handlers) on (DualHandlerExport) will use first method found (JmxDualHandlerExportHandlerTwo.canCallAStepMethodExportedByBoth)
    And I call a step method exported by both handlers in DualHandlerExport                  PASSED  
    Then the ambiguity is logged and one of the matching steps is called in DualHandlerExportPASSED
