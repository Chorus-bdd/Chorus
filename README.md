###Chorus is a BDD testing framework targeted at distributed architectures###

Chorus is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) testing framework written in Java.

It is targeted at distributed system testing, which is more complex than testing a single development stack.

Chorus allows a team to write plain English tests which can execute test steps on components running remotely.

It supports an extended version of the 'Gherkin' syntax popularised by Cucumber and JBehave.
The Gherkin extensions and other features of the framework may be useful to you even if your project is not distributed.

Chorus presently provides a solution to connect to and test Java (or JVM-based) components.
We hope to add connectivity solutions for other languages in the near future
