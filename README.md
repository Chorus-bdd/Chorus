###Chorus is a BDD testing framework targeted at distributed architectures###

Chorus is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) testing framework written in Java.

It is targeted at distributed system testing. It allows a team to define plain English tests in which some or all
scenario steps are executed in components running remotely over the network - _Executable Specifications for Distributed Systems._

Chorus supports an extended version of the 'Gherkin' syntax popularised by Cucumber and JBehave, these extensions help to make the framework a pragmatic choice for programmers.

Chorus is a Java framework and presently provides a solution to connect to and test Java components.
We hope to add connectivity solutions for other languages in the near future

In addition to its Remoting features, Chorus also provides process handling which makes it easy to stop and start processes during a scenario.
