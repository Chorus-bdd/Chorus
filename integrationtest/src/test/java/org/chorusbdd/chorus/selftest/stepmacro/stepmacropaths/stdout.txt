  Scenario: Calling a global macro
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Calling a global macro
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can call a global macro with three variables lemon 123 and aardvark              
    .. Then I can call the macro from any feature file since macros are preparsed            PASSED  
    .. And variables are all expanded within the macro steps for example lemon 123 aardvark  PASSED  lemon.123.aardvark
