Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Simple Step Macro Scenario
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can call a step macro with two variables 1234 and mytestgroup                    
    .. Then I can call a handler step with group 1234                                        PASSED  1234
    .. And I can call a handler step which is unimplememted and this will fail               UNDEFINED 
    .. And I can call a step which is unimplemented and this will be skipped                 SKIPPED 
    And Chorus is working properly                                                           SKIPPED
