    Given I start a echo process named myecho                                                PASSED  
    When I write the line 'Donald Bradman was the greatest of all time' to the myecho process PASSED  
    And I read the line 'Donald Bradman was the greatest of all time' from the myecho process PASSED  
    Then I write the line 'you speak the truth, wise one' to the myecho process              PASSED  
    And I read the line 'you .* wise one' from the myecho process                            PASSED
