    First I start a remotePolled process                                                     PASSED  
    And I connect to the remotePolled process                                                PASSED  
  Scenario: Step Retry Is Working In Local Handler

    Given I increment a value with a timer task                                              PASSED  
    And the value is 1 within default period                                                 PASSED  
    When I increment a value with a timer task                                               PASSED  
    Then the value is 2 within 2 seconds                                                     PASSED  
    When I increment a value with a timer task                                               PASSED  
    Then the value is not 3 within 0.2 seconds so this step should fail                      FAILED  Expect 3 expected:<3> but was:<2> (StepRetryHandler:linenumber)-AssertionError
  Scenario: Long running step method overruns passes within period
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Long running step method overruns passes within period
    When I call a 1 second to run step method with passes within 1 second annotation         FAILED  Whoops (StepRetryHandler:linenumber)-AssertionError
    Then the next step runs 1 second later                                                   SKIPPED 
  Scenario: I can immediately break out of a Step Retry by throwing FailImmediatelyException
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: I can immediately break out of a Step Retry by throwing FailImmediatelyException
    When call a passes within step method it can be terminated immediately by FailImmediatelyException FAILED  Fail this step immediately - time elapsed 0 seconds (StepRetryHandler:linenumber)-FailImmediatelyException
  Scenario: Remoting with Step Retry
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Remoting with Step Retry
    When I start a timer                                                                     PASSED  
    Then test condition eventually passes                                                    PASSED  
    And another test condition fails with AssertionError                                     FAILED  remote ChorusAssertionError - Failed condition (RemoteProcessWithPolledAssertion$MyHandler:linenumber)-JmxRemotingException
  Scenario: Exceptions fail tests with remote Step Retry
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Exceptions fail tests with remote Step Retry
    Then another test condition fails with Exception                                         FAILED  remote Exception - My Exception Message (RemoteProcessWithPolledAssertion$MyHandler:linenumber)-JmxRemotingException
  Scenario: Runtime Exceptions fail tests with remote Step Retry
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Runtime Exceptions fail tests with remote Step Retry
    Then another test condition fails with RuntimeException                                  FAILED  remote RuntimeException - My Runtime Exception Message (RemoteProcessWithPolledAssertion$MyHandler:linenumber)-JmxRemotingException
  Scenario: I can immediately break out of a remote Step Retry by throwing FailImmediatelyException
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: I can immediately break out of a remote Step Retry by throwing FailImmediatelyException
    When call a passes within step method remotely it can be terminated immediately by FailImmediatelyException FAILED  remote FailImmediatelyException - Fail this step immediately - time elapsed 0 seconds (RemoteProcessWithPolledAssertion$MyHandler:linenumber)-JmxRemotingException
