  Scenario: Simple Scenario One
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Simple Scenario One
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a step in scenario one                                                    PASSED  
    And if a step fails                                                                      FAILED  This step threw an exception to fail it (MultipleScenarioHandler:linenumber)-ChorusAssertionError
    Then the subsequent steps are skipped                                                    SKIPPED 
    But the next scenario still runs                                                         SKIPPED

    And if a step is not implemented                                                         UNDEFINED
