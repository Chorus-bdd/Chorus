Feature: Failed Step                                                                                 
Chorus --> INFO    - Running feature from file: src/test/java/org/chorusbdd/chorus/selftest/failedstep/failedstep.feature
  Scenario: Simple Scenario
Chorus --> INFO    - Processing scenario: Simple Scenario
    Given Chorus is working properly                                                         PASSED  
    Then I can run a feature with a single scenario                                          PASSED  
    And if a step fails                                                                      FAILED  This step threw an exception to fail it (FailedStepHandler:linenumber)-ChorusAssertionError
    Then the subsequent step is skipped                                                      SKIPPED
