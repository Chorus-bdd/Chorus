        <!-- In general the philosophy is that because Chorus is a library, we are trying to
        avoid any mandatory dependencies on other libraries, otherwise components using Chorus would be forced
        to inherit those extra dependencies

        For this reason Spring features have been pushed down into Chorus-Spring module,
        and certain other features into Chorus-tools. Users seeking to run an interpreter with
        these features enabled need to declare dependencies on these derived modules, as appropriate

        The basic Chorus interpreter and the JMX remoting feature should run just fine with the
        main chorus.jar and the JDK -->
