The token classes of this package are models representing the state/results of the test execution

They may be passed to a renderer / test execution listener which logs or displays information
about test progress and results

Chorus supports both local ExecutionListener and remotely registered jmx ExecutionListener which
receive rpc style callbacks with serialized tokens
