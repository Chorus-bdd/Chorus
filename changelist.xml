        <comment>Add support to allow non-java processes or scripts to be launched and configured with properties in the same manner as java processes.</comment>
        <change desc="Added a pathToExecutable property for the Processes Handler. This can be a relative path from the feature directory or an absolute path. Where set this causes Chorus to treat the process as a native process instead of launching a new jvm instance. The other non-java-specific properties may be set as usual so that native processes now have first class support."/>
