## Downloading Chorus

There are several ways you can run Chorus - as a JUnit test suite integrated with a Java project, as a standalone command line tool, or as a Docker container.

The way you get and run Chorus will differ for each of these.  
See [Getting Started](/pages/GettingStarted/GettingStarted) for more information.
