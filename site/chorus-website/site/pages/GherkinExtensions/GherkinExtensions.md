Chorus provides several Gherkin language extensions [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin), which let you do more within .feature files

* [Feature Start and End](/pages/GherkinExtensions/FeatureStartAndEnd) - Add initialization and tear down at feature level
* [Directives](/pages/GherkinExtensions/Directives) - Annotate your feature with technical directives to influence how your tests get run
* [Context Variables](/pages/BuiltInHandlers/ChorusContext/ChorusContext) - Store and access variables within your test steps
* [Scenario Outline Tags](/pages/GherkinExtensions/ScenarioOutlineTags) - Add tags within scenario outline tables
* [Configurations](/pages/GherkinExtensions/Configurations) - Run a feature more than once using different configuration properties
