We think Chorus is a futuristic test framework, so let's go with a futuristic example..

Let's assume we're trying to test the systems on a spacecraft.
Various distributed components control aspects of the flight.  
Unlike Battlestar Galactica, all those components are networked! 

Let's see if we can use Chorus to test our spacecraft's battle readiness.  

We will need to use Chorus' built in `Remoting` handler and tell it to connect to the navigation, tactical and weaponsControl services, so that the steps each component publishes can be discovered by Chorus.

	Uses: Remoting

	Feature: Cylon Base Ship Attack

	    #! Remoting connect navigation, tactical, weaponsControl
	    Scenario:  Shields up when Cylon Ship Detected
		    Given the spacecraft is undocked
		    When a Cylon ship is detected
		    Then shields go up



###  What do we need to do to make this work? 

The first thing is to [write Handler classes](/pages/Handlers/HandlerClasses) for each component, [and export them](/pages/BuiltInHandlers/Remoting/RemotingHandlerDetails) 

a) Write a NavigationHandler for the navigation process, and export it:

    #File: NavigationHandler.java
	@Handler("Navigation")
	public class NavigationHandler {
		
		@Step("the spacecraft is undocked")
		public void undock() {
			... change state to simulate undocking and publish a message
		}
	}
	
	#File: Navigation.java
	new ChorusHandlerJMXExporter(new NavigationHandler()).export();
	...

b) Do the same for Tactical component:

	@Handler("Tactical")
	public class TacticalHandler {

		@Step("a Cylon ship is detected")
		public void setBaseShipDetected() {
			... change state to simulate ship detection and publish a message
		}
	}

	#File: Tactical.java
    new ChorusHandlerJMXExporter(new TacticalHandler()).export();
    ...

c) For weapons control, we can use the [Step Retry](/pages/DistributedTesting/StepRetry) to allow up to 10 seconds for the shields to go up after the messages are sent (but it shouldn't take that long!)

	@Hander("WeaponsControl")
	public class WeaponsControlHandler {
	
		@Step("shields go up", retryDuration=10)
		public void checkShieldsAreUp(){
            ChorusAssert.assertTrue(getShieldStatus() == UP);
		}
	}

    #File: WeaponsControl.java
    new ChorusHandlerJMXExporter(new WeaponsControlHandler()).export();
    ...

###  Getting this to run 

First we need start up all the components in our simulation environment (UAT). Then, in order to run the tests, we need to provide a feature file, and a properties file next to the .feature file which will tell the chorus interpreter how to connect to these remote components.

What we will end up with is the feature file (e.g. cylonBaseShipAttack.feature) next to a properties file (e.g. cylonBaseShipAttack.properties). 

See [Remoting Handler Details](/pages/BuiltInHandlers/Remoting/RemotingHandlerDetails) for the details of how to set this up

The properties file contains three properties which tell the Chorus interpreter which server and port to connect to for each of our distributed components:

	remoting.navigation.connection=jmx:myserver1.myorg:18806
	remoting.tactical.connection=jmx:myserver2.myorg:18807
	remoting.weaponsControl.connection=jmx:myserver3.myorg:18808



###  Some observations about the architecture 

This is a real-time distributed system we are testing and we assume there are message feeds between each of the components.

The Weapons Control component is subscribing to messages published by the navigation and tactical computers in our
integration testing environment.

It uses these message feeds to make responses to certain situations (e.g. shields up).

In our integration testing environment, we can test these responses are correct by sending a message to the navigation
and tactical components, and asking them to simulate entering a new state (and send appropriate messages).
We are asking these components to publish mock data, to simulate a real condition occurring,
so that we can test the outcome in the weapons control process.

Since we are using message feeds there are latencies involved.
The messages from the navigation and tactical components may take some time to arrive at weaponsControl.
That's why we have used a [Step Retry](/pages/DistributedTesting/StepRetry) (retryDuration) in the weapons control step.
This polls the method for a limited period, waiting for the assertion (shields are up) to be satisfied, instead of failing
immediately if there is a small delay.
