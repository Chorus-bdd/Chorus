Chorus is a lightweight BDD test framework written in Java, with a focus on distributed system testing

Chorus provides an interpreter for BDD-style tests, in which the step definitions can be provided locally,
or exported by different components running as part of a distributed architecture.

Key features:
 * Behaviour Driven Development which replicates most features of the well-known 'Cucumber' framework for Ruby
 * Supports most commonly used keywords from Cucumber's Gherkin syntax
 * Provides additional support for testing highly complex Java distributed systems
 * Modular interpreter architecture that allows projects to extend/customise core features
 * Pure Java implementation
 * Spring integration (feature testing with various Spring configurations)
 * Built in features for process control (start and stop processes during testing)
